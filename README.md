# Australia Election 2019

This project involved thorough sentiment analysis of messages from Twitter regarding the 2019 Australian Election.

This project was completed using PowerBI and the Python programming language. The analysis parsed through the data using text mining functions and Python packages, and rendered a scatterplot and pie charts demonstrating the Polarity (Positivity vs. Negativity) of the social media messages, and the Subjectivity (Personal Opinion vs. Factual Information) housed within the messages. A Word Cloud, highlighting the prominent terms that were frequently used in the messages, is also available.

PowerBI was used to visualize where the messages were published. Using geocode information, the locations of each Tweet were displayed, along with the names of the locations. The corresponding ".pdf" and ".pbix" files are enclosed.



# Credit Card Defaulting In Taiwan

This project was done using Python. Specifically, I used machine learning based classification algorithms to study the credit card crisis of Taiwan. The primary purpose of this paper was to determine which variables of the given dataset were the strongest predictors of default payment. The tests and models that were used to determine these variables were Random Forest Classification, Naive Bayes and Gradient Boosting. The corresponding ".pdf" file is enclosed.



# Used Car Price Prediction And Car Classification With Machine Learning Project

This project deals with predicting the price of used cars. Python was used to perform machine learning with the random forest classification and gradient boosting mechanisms to determine which algorithm better demonstrated ideal sales based on gearboxes.
The corresponding ".ipynb" file is enclosed.



# SQL to Python ETL with EDA, Random Forest Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This project deals with extracting data from a SQL database, transferring the data and loading it into a Python environment and using random forest classification to understand trends based on the ratings of the DVD titles. 
Sentiment Analysis is also used to understand and visualize the language used to describe the DVD titles and break it down based on Polarity and Subjectivity of the sentiment.


# Image Recognition And Classification 

This project deals with the Tensorflow and Keras libraries of Python. I used deep learning to train the recognition and classification algorithm. I used a dataset of images of a variety of vehicles and animals.



The projects in my Portfolio are demonstrations of Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Processing, Data Preprocessing, Statistical Analysis and Data Analytics.
